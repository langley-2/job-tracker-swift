Job Tracker

Job Tracker is a SwiftUI app I built to keep my job search organized. It helps me stay on top of every opportunity — from spotting a role to getting an offer (or not). The goal was to streamline the entire application process and give myself a clearer sense of progress and momentum.

What It Does
Keeps all job applications in one place
Tracks the status of each role — from discovery to final outcome
Stores useful details like contacts, notes, and links
Shows visual indicators for quick status checks
Offers contextual prompts based on where I’m up to with each role
Uses a clean tab-based layout for easy navigation
Status Workflow
Each job moves through defined stages:

Discovered – spotted a role worth exploring
Researching – checking out the company and role
Outreach – making contact with someone at the org
Applied – application submitted
Interviewing – in active interview stages
Offer – received an offer
Accepted – took the offer
Rejected – got a no
Closed – process wrapped (e.g., job was filled, I lost interest, etc.)
Job Detail Tracking
Each job entry captures:

Job title
Company
URL to the listing
Key contact person (if any)
Status flags (research, outreach, application)
Current stage
Notes field for anything relevant
Tech Stack
SwiftUI for the interface
Swift 5
UserDefaults for lightweight persistence (with plans to move to Core Data or SwiftData)
iOS 15.0+ compatible
In Action
The app uses color-coded indicators and subtle visual cues (like progress dots) to show where each application stands. From the detailed view, I can see exactly what needs to happen next — whether that’s researching the company more, sending a follow-up, or preparing for an interview.

What’s Next
Some ideas I’ve scoped out for future iterations:

iCloud sync so I can track across devices
Calendar integration to manage interviews
Uploads for resumes and cover letters
Automated reminders for deadlines
A stats dashboard to visualize overall progress
Smarter filtering and sorting
